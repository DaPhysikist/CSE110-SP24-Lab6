1. I would say I would have to go with option 1 for where I would place my automated tests, using a GitHub action that runs whenever my code is pushed. I would go with this option because it falls perfectly in the middle of all the choices. I think the third option is too extreme and could lead to many things breaking unexpectedly at the end due to lack of sufficient testing, but I also think that having developers run tests locally might be extreme in the other end, forcing them to run tests before making any small change. Also, this would mean that the developers would have to be trusted to test properly, and code would be assumed tested when pushed to GitHub, and I think its better to have an automated test where anyone on the team can see the results for better traceability and accountability.

2. No. I would not use an end to end test to check if a function is returning the correct output, and would instead use a unit test.
